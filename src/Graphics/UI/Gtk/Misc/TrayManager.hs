{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface, EmptyDataDecls #-}
-- | This module implements a TrayManager - an integral part of a
-- Linux system tray widget, though it is not itself a widget.  This
-- package exports a single GObject (for use with gtk2hs) that
-- implements the freedesktop.org system tray specification (it
-- handles receiving events and translating them into convenient
-- signals, along with the messy work of dealing with XEMBED).
--
-- The basic usage of the object is to:
--
-- 1. Instantiate the object with 'trayManagerNew'
--
-- 2. Have it manage a specific screen with 'trayManagerManageScreen'
--
-- 3. Set up handlers for the events exposed by the tray (e.g., 'trayIconAdded').
--
-- As an example, a functional system tray widget looks something like:
--
-- > import Graphics.UI.Gtk
-- > import Graphics.UI.Gtk.Misc.TrayManager
-- > systrayNew = do
-- >   box <- hBoxNew False 5
-- >   trayManager <- rayManagerNew
-- >   Just screen <- screenGetDefault
-- >   trayManagerManageScreen trayManager screen
-- >   on trayManager trayIconAdded $ \w -> do
-- >     widgetShowAll w
-- >     boxPackStart box w PackNatural 0
--
-- Note that the widgets made available in the event handlers are not
-- shown by default; you need to explicitly show them if you want that
-- (and you probably do).
